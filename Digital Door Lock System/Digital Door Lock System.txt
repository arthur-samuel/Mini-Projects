Digital Door Lock System

Description:
The Digital Door Lock System project aims to provide a secure and convenient solution for controlling access to a door using an Arduino microcontroller. The project is implemented in two versions:

Potentiometer-regulated Version: In this version, the door lock system is controlled by set parameters regulated by a potentiometer. The rotation of the potentiometer determines the access control parameters, such as the allowed range of values for unlocking the door.

Keypad Lock System Version: The second version of the project utilizes a keypad lock system for access control. Users are required to input a specific code via the keypad to unlock the door.
Both versions of the project are simulated and tested using the Arduino microcontroller platform and Proteus simulation software.

Components:
Arduino Microcontroller
Potentiometer (for version 1)
Keypad (for version 2)
Servo Motor (for controlling the door lock mechanism)
LCD Display (for displaying system status and messages)
 Jumper Wires

Features:
Secure access control mechanism.
User-friendly interface for inputting access codes (version 2).
Real-time monitoring and display of system status.
Versatile implementation allows for customization and expansion.
